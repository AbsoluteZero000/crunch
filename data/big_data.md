## The Boy Who Lived: A Grand Overture

The storm raged outside, a symphony of wind and rain battering the ancient stone walls of Number Four, Privet Drive. Inside, a lone figure paced the length of the living room, his face a mask of worry. Vernon Dursley, a portly man with a handlebar moustache, squinted at the clock on the mantlepiece, his brow furrowed in an irritated frown.

"It's almost eleven," he muttered, his voice a low rumble that reverberated through the room. "That wretched boy… he's gone too far this time."

His wife, Petunia, sat on the worn velvet sofa, her fingers nervously twisting a lace handkerchief. Her usually pale face was flushed, her eyes flitting nervously between the door and the clock.

"He's just a child, Vernon," she whispered, her voice strained. "He doesn't know any better."

Vernon snorted, his gaze fixed on the flickering flames in the fireplace. "He's a menace, Petunia. A walking disaster. And we're the ones who have to deal with it."

Their son, Dudley, sprawled across the floor, a giant bowl of chocolate ice cream melting in his lap. He was too engrossed in his latest video game to pay any attention to the tense atmosphere surrounding him.

A sudden, deafening crash echoed through the house, followed by the sound of shattering glass. The Dursleys exchanged startled glances, their hearts pounding in their chests. Vernon was the first to rise, his face a mask of fury.

"Dudley! Go check what that racket was!" he barked, his voice booming.

Dudley, momentarily distracted from his game, groaned and lumbered to the front door. He pushed it open, his eyes widening in disbelief.

"Dad, there's... there's a giant letter!" he stammered, his voice trembling with a mixture of fear and excitement.

Vernon and Petunia exchanged another look, their fear now tinged with a chilling dread. They knew what those letters meant, what they foreshadowed.

Their worst fears were confirmed as Dudley stumbled back into the house, a large, parchment-covered letter clutched in his pudgy hands. It was addressed in an emerald green ink, the writing swirling and elegant:

"Mr. H. Potter,
The Cupboard under the Stairs,
4 Privet Drive."

Vernon, his face turning a sickly shade of green, snatched the letter from Dudley's trembling hand. He ripped it open, his eyes scanning the contents with a mixture of rage and fear.

"This is madness," he spat, his voice cracking. "He's gone too far! He's playing tricks on us!"

Petunia, her face white as snow, stared at the letter in horror. She knew what it meant, what it promised.

"We can't let him get his hands on Harry," she choked out, her voice barely a whisper.

But it was too late.

A wave of magical energy pulsed through the house, the windows rattling violently. From outside, a deep booming voice echoed, sending shivers down their spines:

"Mr. Harry Potter… the world is waiting..."

The Dursleys huddled together, their faces pale with terror. The storm raged on, the house trembling under the onslaught of magic. The air crackled with an unseen force, and a wave of fear washed over them, leaving them feeling powerless and insignificant.

For in that moment, the world had changed. Harry Potter, the boy who lived, was about to embark on a journey that would forever alter the course of history.
